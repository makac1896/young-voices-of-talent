Who is a brother and a father? Actually the real question is what is a brother and a father?
Why am I even questioning this, do they deserve to be named are they even human. I am Hakim and I am one of the many daughters my “ so called father has” I swear I do not  think he deserves to be called a father if I don't feel protected in his presence at all.I mean pardon me for the hate but I am certainly justified for saying that.I live to discover what a brother and are father because the experience I got only tainted my view.
\r\n
As mentioned before I am Hakim and I apologise for the rough introduction I gave I guess I should tell my story in a clear way now.It all started on a moonless night in the month of Harvest ,when I was brought to this world.A world that I believe is full of odds.I was the fourth daughter of my father and the second daughter of the second wife.It was exactly a year before my supposed to be brother was born,Hakyle. He was the first son to my father and his fourth wife.He was the only “brother” to all the girls and we were even given similar names giving us a greater reason for us to have a huge bond, one that is not breakable We were actually twins.
\r\n
We looked so much alike and we played together everyday.We did not go to the same school because I was a boarder but I always looked forward to meeting my other half when school closes.I thought he had the same feeling but I was mistaken I guess.I still ask myself if he ever saw me as a sister or I was just the “ other girl” to him.It so happened that my father treated us like twins to the extent that we got the exact same clothes just different colors maybe.My father made all his children live in one house and that made him the only parent we all lived with besides he is the only reason we are siblings.My mother worked out of the country and I only got to see her once a year that was just before the christmas holiday.
\r\n
When I was fourteen and my brother was thirteen I knew I had someone to relate to in terms of all the changes we were both experiencing.We would spend the day together and I actually preferred not to go out with friends and spend the day with my favourite brother.We were usually at home together and the only ones in the house, I mean why would I be afraid to do so.He was my protector one who made sure all the boys who bullied me were scared to death.My whole perspective changed after this one day.
\r\n
It was a fateful day and we were left alone at home as usual.I was not scared or was I bothered I felt protected and safe.He walked into my room and this time shutting the door and locking it.I did not sense anything off , I just thought that it was a game he wished to play with his sister.Maybe we were to play tag and I set on my bed waiting for him to say the instructions of the game.
\r\n
The look on his face was not as innocent anymore.It seemed as if he wanted something, my heart was beating but I could not explain why I was so scared.In my mind I had no reason to be.He moved so swiftly but so aggressively.The next second I was in a black world I can not explain the darkness so thick that the daylight was no more.He had taken what I thought he should have protected as a brother.He took my pride, comfort, teen life and even my confidence away.He took what a brother was supposed to protect.He did to me what we do not talk about in my culture.He made me hate myself , he made me feel tiny and vulnerable.
\r\n
It took me two days to gather enough courage to talk about this.I told my mother when she got back from Malawi.I feel sorry for her considering the fact that she had to deal with this after a very long journey.When I told her, she screamed alarming my dad.He came to my room and what came to his mind was him slapping me.I did nothing wrong but maybe to his justification his adrenaline was in a fight mode but why would he fight his daughter?He was told about the sinful act his son did to me but he chose to deny the truth.
\r\n
This is my story, I am sure now you justify me for the hate I have towards the two most prominent male figures in my life.He took my pride but not my dream.I have a Dream one that is crystal clear.One worth fighting for.That dream that is the best place for us to start from.The future I yearn for defines a brother and a father as protectors.Those who will be there for us.Where every girl deserves a protector .This time my heart beats , beating with so much passion. I have been geared to revenge to make a future worth living for all girls.
