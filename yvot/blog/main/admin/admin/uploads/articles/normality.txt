 Study hard, make us proud
 Do your best, better than the rest 
You should have respect 
Do not talk with your fists
\r\n
Forget we are not together
Even though it is engraved on your forehead 
Imagine we are are a happy family 
Be the glue to the shattered home
\r\n
We are not the best parents
But better believe us we are not there for good intentions
Why did you not say a word? 
The world needs to see how strong you are 
\r\n
Sleep late, Do not shed tears 
Do you want something? Tell her 
She will tell you to tell him
To the world perfect, make it seem 
\r\n
We separated for your good
I promise you it was all for the best 
Is it hard to accept, For normality 
You have always dreamt
