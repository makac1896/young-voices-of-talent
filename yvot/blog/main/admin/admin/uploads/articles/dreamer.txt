I tell a story of a little African girl born and
 raised in a culture that was tightly attached to her navel. 
A girl of strong opinions but never had a chance to voice them. 
A girl who claims to be the pride of Africa but
is still afraid to speak on its behalf. 
The girl who wishes to change the world but 
is relying on a set of dreams she can’t even interpret. 
Books are her source of comfort only 
knowing one route to a tomorrow she yearns for. 
Is studying really worth it or it is giving her false comfort?
\r\n
A girl of many dreams and ambitions too big that 
They even scare her to sleep but they never fade. 
She speaks her own language,  
a language of confidence and determination. 
A language that only she can understand, 
one that knows no hate or shade. 
She sees tomorrow but is tomorrow really that colorful?
\r\n
Her story is definitely not the disney type
It doesn’t promise  a happy ever after 
But instead it shows different angles of a real life
One which is not clothed but purely naked
A life full of hate and hurt 
A life that demands her to be strong
\r\n
Is she really that strong? Or is she wrong?
Is this life truly her’s or they made it their’s 
Is her pain worth the gain
Will the rain fall when she starts her reign 
\r\n
A queen indeed, powerful yet mindful
A ruler in her own world but humbled 
By what they call life, Lives to tell her story
A story of a dreamer, a story of a victor 
A story of a ‘normal’ African girl.
