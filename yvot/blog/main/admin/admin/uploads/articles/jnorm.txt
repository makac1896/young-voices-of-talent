“Jonal”
“Jonal” I managed to separate the sound of the rain and my aunt’s wake up call.
”Amai” I said half asleep just to make sure that she stops calling me so that  I could finish my dream about my visit to my previous school.Maybe it was a part of me manifesting how much I miss it or it was a genuine dream that is caused by how tired I will be by the time I sleep.I realised that I slept half way through my preparation time and I was forced to do everything in a short period of time.Something about this school day was off.Something stood out for real. I ignored my gut feelings and made sure that I contacted my friends about the weather before I left the house.I did this mostly because I care about them and would appreciate if they chose a weather appropriate outfit for the day.I also did this partly because I check the weather every morning to avoid freezing to death.Disclaimer- there is no snow in Zimbabwe it's  just me being afraid of low temperatures.
\r\n
I rushed out of the house to make sure that I was not late for school at least.It had stopped raining but I walked slowly and carefully because the roads were muddy and a wrong step would lead me to the ground.The odds were indeed on my side , I got into the first car that stopped at the bus stop .Little did I know I was going to meet a character like my father.I observed quietly in the comfort of the back seat near the window, he was so rude and not understanding at all.I did not let this major similarity get to me but only one incident stood out actually there were two.
\r\n
I guess I will let the first one slip away.As an observer I watched from a distance and did not dare to comment even though I was burning with the edge to speak.So basically there was a man who joined our ‘interesting trip” half way through it.He tried negotiating the price and to everyone’s surprise the driver agreed.Everything changed when it was time to pay for the trip.The men who had negotiated unfortunately had been misunderstood.He was apparently ten  cents short and the driver decided to leave him in the middle of nowhere because he was short.I mean I do understand that the driver needs to the money to earn a living but is he not supposed to be a little bit considerate.Thanks to the fine lady who was next to him, he was not dropped off she  she paid his balance.
\r\n
I thanked the heavens when I reached my destination. I could not stand this man any longer.I rushed to get my next bus, this one leading me to school,finally!! It felt like a relief at least I was going to be distracted from the view of Zimbabwe I see beyond the borders of my school.My journey to and from school reminds me of the sad reality  that there are two sides of Zimbabwe one that I would like to call “sweet”.The best part of Zimbabwe one that only those who could afford got to experience.The other side, always hidden from tourists the bitter part of Zimbabwe.One that made cruelty a way of survival.I am one of the lucky Zimbabweans who gets a chance to experience both on a daily basis.
\r\n
My journey home was the most interesting and a little bit shaking.I got off the bus with the desire to get home as soon as possible.Regardless of the fact that I new this dream will never come true.Only because I lived so far and also because transport is hard to find after school and if it is in abundance it will be a little expensive.Its either I pressurise by the “combi” door, maybe lose my laptop and also possibly contract the virus .Or I just wait for the right transport which will take more than an hour but I will be safe in all ways possible.
\r\n
On this particular day I walked a little bit slowly thinking about how I will get home.I was awaken from my day dreaming by a call just in front of me.”Thief,thief” the lady guard screamed.The adrenaline pumped in my body was enough for me to take off but the curious part of my brain made me search for my surrounding in the hope of locating the thief.It is not like I was going to contribute in some way in the chasing of the thief.At least not after being warned about minding my business or I would face a painful death in the wrong hands.
\r\n
It took me a few seconds to realise that I was looking right into the eyes of the accused.She was well dressed and was moving very fast.When she heard the cry she started to run as fast as possible.I mean I know a lot of people make a living from stealing but I never met one in person.I  stood at a safe distance from the scene and watched the action.She was so fast but she was almost ran over by a bus.If she could risk her life for a pair of jeans what more can she do?She was finally caught and I was there to witness her walk of shame as the security guard held her tightly and dragged her back to the store.
\r\n
I managed to listen in to a lot of people’s perspectives about this thief.One lady gave out her claim, “ she was on training “ and backed it up with the evidence that she got caught.Some claimed that she was being helped by others and her teammates abandoned her.I chose to think of her as someone forced into this by her life situation.”Anyway who am I to judge maybe its just a bad habit she grew into while growing up.”This was my conclusion as I listened to my soul music on my last bus of the day.
