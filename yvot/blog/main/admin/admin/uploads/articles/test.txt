Good evening to you all, today we stand at threat to two things a government in sheep’s clothing and a terrorist group. \r\n Only fate can tell which is worse, but this is not the case today as we face a threat from both groups and this is oddly initiated by the government itself. The motion today is not one whereby we should focus on military superiority or preparedness but other intrinsic details. Zimbabwe is a signatory of the Geneviève Consensus which 196 nations agreed to use non-violent methods to resolve disputes among them; this is the same government we see today advocating for a ‘friendly war’ without a history of a conflict between the ZDF and Boko Haram. It is in the light of humanitarian peace that I am proud to oppose!!! \r\n
Before going any further let me start with some rebuttals to the opening government’s arguments.
The prime minister says that the ZDF has virtually no technology for combat simulation, this just shows us that he is a militaristic leader with no feelings or remorse for the lives that could be lost as a result of his policy. We can never put a price on a human life and if the issue is on preparedness of the army why not just invest in the combat simulation? \r\n That is far more cheaper than going to actual war and no lives are lost
He also talks of how the war would be non-hostile, ladies and gentlemen war is not a romantic event where words do the damage but in war guns do. The fact that this a war between an army and a terrorist group makes violence inevitable. \r\n This point is under thought  and completely irrelevant in this debate.
He talks of a virtual war with Boko Haram, if they plan on virtual combat why then not just invest in combat simulation? Soldiers are humans and unless there is a real military threat their lives must not be put at harm, we are not Zulus and the prime minister is not Tshaka and thereby must think likewise.
