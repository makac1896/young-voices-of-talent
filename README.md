## Project Brief

**YVOT** is an organization dedicated to helping and promoting young talent in Zimbabwe. It is a non-profit organization founded by a group of ten young people committed to driving positive change. The idea was conceived in June 2020, with preliminary discussions beginning late June 2020. The team is composed of individuals with diverse talents, including a development team, marketing team, and content team.

The primary goal of this project is to utilize the power of media to promote young talent, with a specific focus on Zimbabwean youth. The platform will initially take the form of a website, with plans for growth and development as resources become more available. The project is currently in the drafting phases of development, with a target launch date of December 2020. YVT aims to be a game changer in youth empowerment, and the team possesses the necessary talent to make it a reality. Features and web functionality will be decided upon in later discussions.

## What YVOT.com is Expected to Do

- Allow content uploads from admin accounts (Note: The first build of the website will not allow people to create accounts).
- Enable content editing once it's on the site.
- Allow users to like and comment on posts.
- Provide a search feature for posts.
- Support various media types, including videos, images, audios, and text as part of the web content.
- Include a functional contact feature.

## Development Schedule

Due to the team's student commitments and demanding school workloads, development has been divided into a 5-month timeline. The initial prototype of the site, however, can be completed in less time. The majority of the schedule will be dedicated to testing and simulating functionality.

The development team consists of three developers: Makatendeka (Full Stack Development), Harmony (Design and Frontend), and Ashley (Frontend). They are fortunate to have mentorship from Tinashe Chivhanga, an experienced developer.

Development has been split into 3 phases:

### Design Phase

- Drafting creative designs, including logos and selecting the platform's overall look.
- Discussion and implementation of features.
- Design of database structures and data processing.
- Selection of languages and technologies for development.
- Initial development and webpage building.
- Expected duration: 4 weeks.

### Build Phase

- Implementation of designs and creation of a working prototype.
- Implementation of all platform features.
- Development of algorithms and functions.
- Preliminary testing.
- Expected duration: 4 weeks.

### Testing and Marketing

- Fundraising and marketing efforts for the platform.
- Extensive testing, possibly hosting the website for live testing.
- Domain acquisition.
- Securing support from schools and local institutions.
- Ensuring a fully functional site.
- Expected duration: 8 weeks.

This is a brief outline that will guide the development of the platform. The project requires dedication and hard work from the team, as it could be a breakthrough opportunity for top universities and scholarships. Suggestions, solutions, and ideas are always welcome, and regular meetings and communication through WhatsApp Voice or Video calls may be necessary to discuss progress.

Enjoy your journey in making YVT a reality.
